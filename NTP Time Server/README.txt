NTPServer.py : downloaded from the Net. Multi threaded NTP server. Complex!
QDNTPServer.py : Quick and dirty minimalistic NTP server. Works well (on Windows and Raspberry Pi) with Tasmota clients.
NTPClient.py: client to test the QD-NTP server. It can be also pointed at any standard NTP server like 0.in.pool.ntp.org.
