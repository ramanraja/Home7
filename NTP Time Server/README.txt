The client is mainly useful to test the ESP8266 based Q&DIY NTP server. There is also a Q&D Python server to prototype the logic.
QDNTPServer.py : Quick and dirty minimalistic NTP server. Works well (on Windows and Raspberry Pi) with Tasmota clients.
NTPClient.py: client to test the QD-NTP server. It can be also pointed at any standard NTP server like 0.in.pool.ntp.org.
